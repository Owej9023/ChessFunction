# ChessFunction

This is a RShiny application that is designed with the chess player in mind.
I Created this application in order to help players discover where their weaknesses are and figure out how they can improve.
This is currenly in the early stages of development and I am working on the more complex analysis of player behavior.

Both versions of test are templates that I use to test new features for the Rshiny application.

Server.R is where all the logic is held for the application. It is highly reccomended that you try any new features in test before applying them to the server.

Ui.R is where the Ui for the application is. This is not my area of expertise so I mostly use it as a to-do list.
